class_name XRPickArea

# XRPickArea defines Where and How an object can be picked
# To disable it from being picked up, disable "monitorable"
#
# There are three modes (Actually only two working currently):
# +) Pose Change Picking: Get picked up when XRPickupFunction
#	notices that the hand changed pose while it's in this XRPickArea.
#	The new hand pose must be in one of pose_change_pick_poses, while
#	the previous pose was not.
#	Note: Useful for grabbing gesture.
#	Example: Grabbing gun at blaster_dc_15.tscn
#
# +) Touch Picking: Get picked up when XRPickupFunction touch
#	this XRPickArea and its current hand pose is in one of touch_pick_poses
#	Note: Not really sure in which general case it could be useful.
#
# NOTE: For more information about hand poses, check hand_pose_matcher
